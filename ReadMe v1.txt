GAME DESCRIPTION:
Extraction Protocol is an intense mission-based first-person shooter that throws players into a treacherous world infested with alien creatures and relentless enemies. As VACs (Versatile Assault Combatants), players must tackle a series of challenging objectives that only they can handle. With each mission, strategic thinking becomes crucial as players select character classes, employ unique abilities, and wield an array of weapons to overcome formidable obstacles. Upon arrival at the mission location, players must quickly devise their approach, carefully navigating the terrain and engaging in relentless combat. The primary objective requires players to locate and eliminate three hive nests. Once the primary objective is accomplished, players must initiate the Extraction Protocol and hold their ground as hordes of enemies descend upon them, testing their resistance and skill. Surviving the onslaught is paramount, as only those who make it through this final trial will successfully extract from the mission. Prepare to dive into the heart-pounding action of Extraction Protocol, where swift thinking, teamwork, and mastery of combat skills are essential to survive and accomplish your mission.

GAME OBJECTIVE:
The primary mission objective is to Search and Destroy 3 Hive Nests. There are three variations of Hive Nests: Basic/Undeveloped Nest, Reinforced Nest, and the Main Hive Nest.
The Basic/Undeveloped Nest is located in Area 1 and requires explosives dropped from orbit to clear it. Players are restricted to this zone until the nest is destroyed. The Reinforced Nest, found in Area 2 (Facility), requires a laser cutter that is dropped in from orbit. Players must defend the laser cutter during the 2-minute cutting process. The Main Hive Nest, situated in Area 3, necessitates the transmission of coordinates for an airstrike. Players must defend the terminal during the 3-minute upload process.
Once the Main Nest is eliminated, all enemies become extremely aggressive. At this point, players receive a prompt to head towards an extraction point, with two options available: Area 4 and Area 5.
In addition to the primary objective, there is a secondary mission objective which involves collecting Specimen Samples from enemies. These samples have a 1/20 chance of dropping from any enemy, and players must gather 10 of them. The data from these samples needs to be uploaded at a terminal, which can be found in Area 2 (inside the facility) and Area 3 (inside a building near the main hive).
For the Extraction phase, players must reach one of the landing zones to initiate the Extraction Protocol. The extraction process takes 3 minutes, during which players will face constant spawns of enemies until the dropship arrives to safely extract them.
