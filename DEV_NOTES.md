# Developer Notes – Capstone Game Project

## Project Overview

This project was created as the final Capstone for my Game Development degree at Full Sail University. It was developed by a 3-person team using **Unreal Engine 5** and **C++** via **Visual Studio**. We utilized **Perforce** for version control and team collaboration.

The game is a **2-player cooperative** tactical shooter featuring multi-phase objectives, team-based mechanics, and coordinated mission pacing.

Our team followed a structured development pipeline modeled after a real-world studio sprint. The project was broken into **three major phases**, each with sprint planning and weekly check-ins. Prior to development, we prepared and submitted:
- A **Coding Standards Document** to align formatting and practices
- A detailed **Game Design Document (GDD)**
- A full **Technical Design Document (TDD)**
- A **Feature List**
- An initial **Pitch Presentation** with three game ideas, one of which was greenlit by instructors

## My Contributions

- **UI/UX Development**: Fully designed and programmed all **menus**, including the Main Menu, HUD, and Settings screens using **Unreal Engine 5 and C++**.
- **Audio Programming**: Integrated and coded all **footstep sounds**, **background music**, and **UI audio cues**.
- **Level Design & Implementation**: Built and scripted key gameplay areas including **the cave**, **starting area**, and mapped out **the canyon**. Worked on **landscape sculpting**, **skybox setup**, and in-scene asset placement.
- **Cinematic Scripting**: Created and programmed the **destructible rock cinematic sequence**.
- **Asset Optimization**: Fixed technical issues with **ship models**, including scaling adjustments and collision setup.
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked as part of a **3-person team** using **Perforce** for version control, ensuring smooth asset and code synchronization.


## Tech Stack

- Unreal Engine 5
- C++
- Visual Studio
- Perforce (Version Control)
- Git (for portfolio showcasing)

## Game Summary

A sci-fi tactical shooter with a mission-based structure:

- **Main Objective**: Search and destroy three Hive Nests of increasing complexity.
  - **Basic Nest** (Area 1): Destroyed with orbital explosives.
  - **Reinforced Nest** (Area 2): Requires a laser cutter and defense phase.
  - **Main Hive** (Area 3): Requires a 3-minute data uplink for airstrike targeting.

- **Secondary Objective**: Collect 10 rare enemy Specimen Samples (1 in 20 drop chance) and upload the data.

- **Extraction**: Players choose one of two LZs and survive a 3-minute extraction under pressure from hostile waves.

## Notes

This repo exists for portfolio purposes only. Assets and systems are uploaded to showcase level design, UI work, and overall structure, with credit to all team members. Reach out if you’d like to know more about the collaborative process or specific contributions.

## Team Credits

This project was developed by a 3-person team for our Capstone at Full Sail University:

- **Johnni Beal** – **UI/UX Developer | Level Designer | Systems Programmer | Quality Assurance**
- **Kyle Worthington** – **Network Engineer | Gameplay Programmer | Systems Programmer**
- **Hayden Rodgers** – **AI Programmer**

  ## Team Credits

- **Johnni Beal** — UI/UX Designer | Systems Programmer | QA Tester  
  Responsible for all UI elements (menus, HUD, settings), sound integration (footsteps, music, UI sounds), level design (landscape, skybox, asset placement, scene construction), cinematic scripting, and asset editing/fixing. Handled all associated implementation in C++ and Blueprints.

- **Kyle Worthington** — Network Engineer | Gameplay Programmer | Systems Programmer  
  Led development of the core multiplayer infrastructure, including server-client communication and player synchronization. Implemented key gameplay systems and mechanics in C++, managed game state logic, and optimized system performance. Played a pivotal role in systems architecture, ensuring scalability and stability for two-player co-op functionality.

- **Hayed Rogers** — AI Programmer  
  Designed and implemented AI behaviors and enemy systems for immersive and responsive gameplay.


Massive thanks to both of them for their dedication, collaboration, and shared passion throughout the entire development process.
